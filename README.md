# Blockchain-Powered Patient Management System

This system is focused on creating a Blockchain-based web application to store and manage patient data. The main aim of this project is to build a robust data managing process to ensure the accuracy and integrity of patient information, benefiting both the healthcare providers and the insurers. Also, this project is focused on employing blockchain technology to guarantee data immutability and protection against external and internal factors by creating a secure and decentralized system for storing comprehensive patient data, including medical records, prescriptions, lab reports, and more.
